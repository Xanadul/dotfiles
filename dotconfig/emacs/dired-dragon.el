;; provies dragon bindings so that you can select files and drag them into whatever you want. here be dragons
;; 1 Commands
;; ==========
;; 1.1 Dired commands
;; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
;;   you mark the file like normal (using `m') and call one of these
;;   commands (flags are what I use for dragon) it will also work if you
;;   are sort of on the file
;;    Command                    Use                                           flags
;;   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;;    `dired-dragon'             dumps all the files and exits once done       `-x -a'
;;    `dired-dragon-stay'        sticks around but dumps all the files         `-a'
;;    `dired-dragon-individual'  you can individually drag and drop the files
;;   I recommend binding them unless you are a `M-x' wizard

;; 1.2 In file commands
;; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
;;   these commands are the original work of @ymarco. Thanks! They open
;;   up a dired instance for the current file unless its an org or tex
;;   file. then it will check for a coresponding .pdf file and drag that
;;   instead
;;    Commands                            use                                                     flag  requires
;;   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;;    `:drag'                             an evil ex command to drag the current buffer and quit  `-x'  *evil*
;;    TODO `dired-dragon-current-buffer'  a vanilla version of the `:drag' command                `-x'  Nothing
;; 3 Configuring
;; =============
;; 3.1 Variables
;; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
;;   if you are on a distro that names dragon differently then you can
;;   change the variable `dired-dragon-location' to the name and or
;;   location of your choice
;;   ,----
;;   | (setq dired-dragon-location (executable-find "YOUR-NAME-HERE"))
;;   | ;; using executable find is a little better as it does not hard code the location
;;   | ;; but this is optional, just provide it with a full path (eg /usr/bin/dragon)
